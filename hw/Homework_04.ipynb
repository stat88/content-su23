    "In all Data 88S homework, you will be providing written answers, not code. We encourage you to hand-write your answers. It is your responsibility to ensure that the homework is submitted completely and properly to Gradescope. **Make sure to assign each page of your pdf to the correct question. Refer to the bottom of the notebook for submission instructions.**\n",

If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",

    "In some of the problems below, you will be provided a code cell that you can use for calculation. You do not need to use the code cell if you don't want to, but you should provide the requested decimal value in your submission. All the libraries you might need have been imported for you. Run the import cell at the top before you start the homework. "
