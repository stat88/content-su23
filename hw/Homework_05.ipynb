Refer to the bottom of the notebook for submission instructions.**\n",

But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",
